# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

The card was created in a **mobile-first workflow** with **semantic HTML markup**, **Flexbox** and **Grid**. It features a **responsive layout**, and text color contrast ratios follow **WCAG 2.0 level AA**.

## My process

### What I learned

In this project, I have practiced the following skills:

- Using **Flexbox** to arrange the content of the card
- **Responsive design:** using **Grid** and **media queries** to create a **responsive layout**
- **Responsive design:** serving different images based on screen size with the `<picture>` element
- Using **CSS relative units** to ensure the text scales according to the user's font size settings
- Creating an **accessible** component by ensuring it uses **WCAG 2.0 level AA** contrast ratios in text
- Using **CSS custom properties** to allow easy customization and reusability of the card
- Using the **BEM naming convention** to create a reusable component with readable code
- Working with **background images**
- Using **Git** and **GitHub**

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue learning **Grid**, as it can be a more convenient layout tool than Flexbox in some situations, especially when the parent element must have a stricter control over the layout, without being affected by the content of the child elements.

### Useful resources

- [_Responsive images_ — MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This article talks about the concept of responsive images and how to serve different images depending on the characteristics of the device.
- [_Kevin Powell - Flexbox vs. Grid_ — CSS Café](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESAXStllfcw) - In this talk, Kevin Powell talks about the differences between Flexbox and Grid and how to decide which one to use. It made me realize that Grid would be better at dividing the card into two equal columns in the desktop layout of this project.
